## Konami Code Easter Egg

The Konami Code is a famous cheat code from video games that when entered on my page triggers a hidden "retro mode" on the page. To activate it:

1. Press the following sequence of keys on your keyboard:
    - `ArrowUp`, `ArrowUp`, `ArrowDown`, `ArrowDown`, `ArrowLeft`, `ArrowRight`, `ArrowLeft`, `ArrowRight`, `B`, `A`

2. Once the code is entered correctly, the website switches to a retro gaming theme with pixelated text, bright green colors, and retro-style font emulating retro arcade cabinets and games. The page returns to its original style when the code is entered again.
